You can use [Bati](https://batijs.github.io/) to scaffold a new Vike app (that uses <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>).

You can also, if you want full control over integration code, use the following command to scaffold a new Vike app (that doesn't use any Vike extension).

<Warning>
We recommend using the following command only if:
 - You are an expert user, and you need control over integration code.
 - You are curious and want to play with integration code.
</Warning>
