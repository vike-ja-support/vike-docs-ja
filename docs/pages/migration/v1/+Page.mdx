If you update to the latest Vike version and you were to apply all deprecation warnings, then you can completely ignore this migration.

This migration page is only for double checking that you applied all deprecation warnings.

1. Update to the latest `0.4` version (`0.4.x`), follow the deprecation warnings which include instructions of how to update outdated code. (TODO/v1-release: replace `x` with actual version number.)
1. Update to `v1.0.0` and, again, follow the new deprecation instructions (if you encounter any) `v1.0.0`. (INTERNAL-NOTE: for example the outdated warning for `pageContext.urlParsed` can only exist in `v1.0.0`)
1. All types have been moved to `'vike/types'`:
   ```diff
   - import type { SomeType } from 'vike/any-path'
   + import type { SomeType } from 'vike/types'
   ```
   And `PageContextBuiltInClient` has been renamed to `PageContextBuiltInClientWithClientRouting` and `PageContextBuiltInClientWithServerRouting`:
   ```diff
   - import type { PageContextBuiltInClient } from 'vite-plugin/client/router'
   + import type {
   +   PageContextBuiltInClientWithClientRouting as
   +   PageContextBuiltInClient
   + } from 'vike/types'

   - import type { PageContextBuiltInClient } from 'vite-plugin/client'
   + import type {
   +   PageContextBuiltInClientWithServerRouting as
   +   PageContextBuiltInClient
   + } from 'vike/types'
   ```

Changes that are relevant only for a (small) subset of users:
 1. The server entry has been renamed from `dist/server/importBuild.js` to `dist/server/entry.js`. (If you manually import the server entry, then make sure to update your import accordingly.)

That's it! Welcome to the `v1` release.
