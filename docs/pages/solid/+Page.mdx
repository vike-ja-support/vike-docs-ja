## `vike-solid`

We recommend using <Link href="/extensions">`vike-solid`</Link> which integrates Solid in a full-fledged manner.

> <p><UseBatiHint feature={<code>vike-solid</code>} /></p>

You can also <Link href="#without-vike-extension">integrate Solid yourself</Link> if you want full control over the Solid integration.


## Without Vike extension

Instead of using a Vike extension, you can manually integrate Solid yourself, giving you full control over the integration of not only Solid itself but also Solid libraries.

Official example:
 - [`vike-solid` source code](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-solid/tree/main/vike-solid) - Full-featured integeration.
