Some [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com) contain invalid JavaScript code.

The most notable errors are invalid [ESM](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/) code, ESM code importing [CJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules:~:text=CommonJS%20modules%20are%20the%20original%20way%20to%20package%20JavaScript%20code%20for%20Node.js) code in an invalid fashion, and invalid CSS imports.

For a solution, see <Link href="#workaround" />.

> The reason why an npm package can contain invalid code is because the transpilation process of some frameworks, most notably Next.js, isn't strict and tolerates erroneous code: thus an npm package can work with Next.js while not work in other JavaScript environments. For further explanation, see <Link href="#why" />.


## Workaround

You can usually workaround problematic npm packages by using [`vite.config.js > ssr.noExternal`](https://vitejs.dev/config/ssr-options.html#ssr-noexternal).

```js
// vite.config.js

export default {
  ssr: {
    // Add problematic npm packages here
    noExternal: ['some-npm-package']
  }
}
```

> The seection <Link href="#why" /> explains why `ssr.noExternal` is a workaround.

You may need to add several/nested npm packages to `ssr.noExternal`, because CJS/ESM issues sometime cascade down along the "`noExternal` boundary" as you add npm packages to `ssr.noExternal`.

If the npm package is CJS code then, instead of `ssr.noExternal`, consider using [vite-plugin-cjs-interop](https://github.com/cyco130/vite-plugin-cjs-interop).

```js
// vite.config.js

import { cjsInterop } from "vite-plugin-cjs-interop";

export default {
  plugins: [
    cjsInterop({
      dependencies: [
        // Add problematic npm package here
        "some-package",
      ]
    })
  ]
}
```

## Why

You may ask yourself, rightfully so, how it's possible that npm packages can publish invalid JavaScript code that doesn't get fixed for months.

The main reason is that some frameworks (such as Next.js) transpile the server-side code of npm packages, whereas Vite transpiles only the client-side code of npm packages. When server-side code contains invalid JavaScript then Node.js crashes and throws one of <Link href="#common-errors">these errors</Link>, while transpilers are more tolerant and transform invalid JavaScript (that Node.js isn't able to execute) into valid JavaScript (that Node.js is able to execute).

By default, Vite doesn't transpile the server-side code of npm packages for a much faster development DX: Node.js directly executes server-side code without involving a slow transpilition process.

That's why <Link href="#workaround">adding an npm package to `ssr.noExternal`</Link> is a workaround if the npm package contains invalid JavaScript.
Essentially, by adding an npm package to `ssr.noExternal`, you replicate the behavior of frameworks like Next.js.


## Common errors

Common invalid JavaScript code.

### Cannot use import statement outside a module

```
SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
```

<CodeBlockTransformer lineBreak="white-space">
```
(node:30335) Warning: To load an ES module, set "type": "module" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension.

</CodeBlockTransformer>

> Node.js's message `set "type": "module" in package.json or use the .mjs extension` is misleading because it means the library's `node_modules/some-library/package.json`, not our `package.json`. It's not really actionable (unless we patch the library, e.g. with [pnpm.packageExtensions](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmpackageextensions) or [pnpm patch](https://pnpm.io/cli/patch)).


### Named export not found

<CodeBlockTransformer lineBreak="white-space">
```
import { SomeImport } from "some-library";
         ^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: Named export 'SomeImport' not found. The requested module 'some-library' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.
CommonJS modules can always be imported via the default export, for example using:

import pkg from 'some-library';
const { SomeImport } = pkg;

    at ModuleJob._instantiate (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:124:21)
    at async ModuleJob.run (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:190:5)

Node.js v18.0.0
```
</CodeBlockTransformer>

The workaround proposed by Node.js often doesn't work for default exports. If it doesn't, try this instead:

```diff
- import theDefaultExport from 'some-library'
+ import lib from 'some-library';
+ const theDefaultExport = lib.default ?? lib
```

> The error is usually thrown when the library's ESM code contains `import './some-file'`. (It should be `import './some-file.js'` instead, as imports in ESM code are required to include the file extension.)


### ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT

<CodeBlockTransformer lineBreak="white-space">

> ESM doesn't allow directory imports: all import paths need to point to a filename instead.


### ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION .css

Another common problem is code importing CSS which makes Node.js crash:

<CodeBlockTransformer lineBreak="white-space">

    at ESMLoader.load (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:605:26)
```
</CodeBlockTransformer>


### Cannot read properties of undefined

The error `Cannot read properties of undefined` is often caused by ESM/CJS issues.

<CodeBlockTransformer lineBreak="white-space">
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProp')
    at someFunction (node_modules/some-good-lib/dist/index.js:1000:3)
    at someHook (renderer/+someHook.js:13:37)
```
</CodeBlockTransformer>

> The underlying issue being:
> ```js
> // node_modules/some-good-lib/dist/index.js
>
> // Because of CJS/ESM issues, someImport is undefined
> import { someImport } from 'some-broken-lib'
>
> // ...
>
> function someFunction() {
>   // TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProp')
>   someImport.someProp
> }
> ```

<Link href="#workaround">Adding `some-broken-lib` to `vite.config.js > ssr.noExternal`</Link> often solves the issue.

> Sometimes, when dependency injection is used, the `import` to `some-broken-lib` isn't in the file in which the
> exception is being raised, making it harder to understand which library is broken. See
> [here](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/discussions/1235) an example of this.



### React invalid component

The following is a common React error and the root cause is usually a CJS/ESM issue.

<CodeBlockTransformer lineBreak="white-space">
```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
    at renderElement (node_modules/react-dom/...)
    at renderNodeDestructiveImpl (node_modules/react-dom/...)
    at renderNodeDestructive (node_modules/react-dom/...)
    ...
```
</CodeBlockTransformer>
Or `got: object`.
<CodeBlockTransformer lineBreak="white-space">
```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object.
```
</CodeBlockTransformer>

React usually logs a component trace before throwing the error:

```
Check your code at +Page.tsx:26.
    at Page
    at div
    at div
    at Layout (/pages/+Layout.tsx:66:19)
```

> Sometimes React doesn't log a component trace. In that case you can use [this temporary patch](https://gist.github.com/brillout/c27b780f009d141acec7bda29d136e6e) to get a component trace.
>
> You can also use the temporary patch to get a more precise component trace. (For example the component trace above says `Check your code at +Page.tsx:26` but there can be hundreds of `+Page.tsx` files and it doesn't say which `+Page.tsx` file it is.)

Use the component trace to find out which component is `undefined` (or an `object`). You'll likely discover that the React component is imported, while the import value is `undefined` or an `object` (instead of a React component) because of CJS/ESM interoperability quirks.

A local workaround is usually this:

```diff
- import SomeComponent from "some-npm-package"
+ import pkg from "some-npm-package"
+ const { SomeComponent } = pkg
+ // Or
+ const SomeComponent = pkg.default
```
