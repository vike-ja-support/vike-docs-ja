## Npm packages containing invalid code

Vite purposely doesn't transpile server-side code but lets Node.js directly execute npm packages (for a much faster development DX).

But some npm packages contain invalid JavaScript code and you need to add them to `vite.config.js > ssr.noExternal`, see <Link href="/broken-npm-package" />.

A recurring problem when doing SSR are so-called *hydration mismatches*: a hydration mismatch is when the content rendered to HTML on the server isn't the same as the content rendered in the browser.
