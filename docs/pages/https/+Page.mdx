In production, Vike is only a server middleware; there is nothing special to take into consideration.

If we want to use HTTPS in dev as well, then we need to pass the HTTPS certificates to Vite's dev server. For example:
 - <Example timestamp="2021.07" repo="aral/vite-plugin-ssr-with-tls" />
   > vite-plugin-ssr was the [previous name of Vike](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/vike).
